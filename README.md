# week-1-challenge

## Description

This was a homework assignment to make this page (Horiseon Marketing) more accessible, adding in alt descriptions, along with making the HTML and CSS more concise and readable. 

This way, if anyone was looking at the HTML or CSS, it is clear which sections are which along with having a more concise CSS. 

I learned that it is better to have more defined semantic elements, so it is easier to tell what each content section is for. 

## Credits

The starting code was provided by UNC in collaboration with 2U/EdX.

I also got assistance from a tutor named Andrew M.

Instructor: Josh B.
TAs: Sean and Santi
